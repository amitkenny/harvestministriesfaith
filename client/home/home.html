			  <h5>How it All began....</h5>
   	         <p class="grey-text text-darken-1">
				We have all sinned and fallen short of the Glory of God. God does exist. The world you see around you is not a chemistry experiment. YOU are not an experiment. You are special. You are beautiful. And you have been created by a loving God. But have all rebelled and tried to live a life independent of God - "All we like sheep have gone astray, every one to his own separate way...". This independence from God is called Sin. Sin brings in corruption and destruction. But we have a perfect God. And because He is perfect, His Justice is perfect. Perfect Justice demands that Sin be wiped out. There is only one way - destroy the Sinner. And that is the <b>Bad News</b>.
	         	
   	         </p>
	  <h5>Now for the Good News</h5>
       <p class="grey-text text-darken-1">
		But because God is perfect, His Love is perfect. Perfect Love, provides a solution. The Solution - a substitute to bear the punishment and judgement due for you, to be metted out to someone else. As a foreshadow of this, the peopleof Israel were asked to kill an animal - a perfect, unblemished animal - the sin of the sinner was symbolically transferred to the animal, and then the animal was killed. But for this to be completely effective - it had to be worldwide, it had to be a Human Sacrifice, it had to be a PERFECT Human Being, the person's Blood had to be shed. But since all have sinned. No one could come forward. About 2000 years ago, a man walked this earth - without sin. That's because He was God come down as Man. And because God is sinless. This was a Sinless Man. And he was slaughtered and executed. And By His Blood we have Redemption. His Name - Jesus Christ. He was crucified on a Cross and by His Death we have received TOTAL SALVATION - if we put our Faith in Him. Not only do we receive forgiveness of our sin - but Glory in place of Shame, Health in place of Sickness, Blessing in place of Curse, Acceptance with God in place of Rejection and most importantly, Peace - Peace that surpasses all understanding - in place of wandering and restlessness. We receive a New Life - and we receive the Holy Spirit. By the Power of His Holy Spirit, we can now live a life of peace and walk on an established path - because we can now live with complete dependence on God. Put your faith in Him - There is only one God - Jesus Christ.
