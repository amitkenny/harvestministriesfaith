	      <h4>THE BLOOD OF JESUS</h4>
	      <p>Through the Blood of Jesus, I am redeemed out of the Hand of Satan. <br>Through the Blood of Jesus, All my Sins are Forgiven. <br>Through the Blood of Jesus, I am cleansed from all impurity of Sin. <br>Through the Blood of Jesus, I receive Justification from God. <br>Through the Blood of Jesus, I am Sanctified, Consecrated and Set Apart for God.  <br>Through the Blood of Jesus, I am reconciled to God and Have Peace with God. <br>My Body is the Temple of the Holy Spirit, Redeemed, Cleansed and Sanctified by the Blood of Jesus. <br>Through the Blood of Jesus, Satan has no power over me, No unsettled Claims over me, All has been Settled by the Blood of Jesus. <br>The Blood of Jesus is speaking on behalf of me in God's Presence right now a better word than Abel's Blood.</p>
